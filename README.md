# forkify in GitHub Pages

The main website of forkify was deployed using Netlify, which seems to have [trouble](https://answers.netlify.com/t/every-netlify-site-i-visit-cant-be-reached-from-the-philippines/49205/17) making websites accessible from certain locations. As an alternate link, forkify was deployed using GitHub Pages and can be viewed [here](https://11jem.github.io/jsproj-forkify/).
